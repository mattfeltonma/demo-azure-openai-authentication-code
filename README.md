# Azure OpenAI Service - Python Example
This repository contains very simple code to demonstrate using the Azure OpenAI Service using Python with Entra ID authentication. 

It demonstrates three patterns:

1. Using the OpenAI Python SDK with a service principal with a client id and client secret.
2. Using the OpenAI Python SDK with a user-assigned managed identity.
3. Using the OpenAI REST API with a service principal with a client id and client secret.

You can read more about the options for authentication within the Azure OpenAI Service at this [blog](https://journeyofthegeek.com/2023/04/02/authentication-in-azure-openai-service/).
